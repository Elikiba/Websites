                  Hey there, I'm Elikiba, an up-and-coming Cloud Engineer or
                  Software Developer (still in the works). I'm playing around
                  with web development and design, which seems fun thus far. I
                  am also one of the best barbers in the world and an elite
                  writer. I schooled in Uniben, practicing ventures in barbing
                  and writing. At heart, I am a Damn Good Businessman.

            So, this was basically my first business, started at 19 years old,
            first by co-owning a fancy caravan with a businessman
            <i>Catalyst</i> in Ekosodin. The first order of business was to get
            2 of Uniben's finest barbers (who were far better than myself at the
            time - I learned from them!) as partners, then we employed a system
            of
            <abbr
              title="Humans naturally make an economic decision to go for the lower prices, but then, 
              we attach value to the more expensive stuff - Human Nature"
              >Reverse Psychology to attract more customers, by increasing our
              price above the average then,</abbr
            >
            together with the superb skill of my 2 guys, <i>Ola & Emmie</i>,
            sales took off! This lasted until we had to fold after COVID. I then
            went off to manage a salon for about a year, then bought one solo
            (with borrowed money - of course!), and stuck with that for about 2
            years until I finished school and had to go for
            <abbr title="National Youth Service Corps">service</abbr>. Couldn't
            find capable hands, so I <i>temporarily</i> closed up. Next, I
            needed to do something that wasn't restricted by geography, and then
            came <strong>AI Writers!</strong>

            I always didn't like writing because it's very slow and mostly
            daunting, but turns out I've always been good at it regardless. So I
            decided to make it my next venture. I had for a few years been
            writing

            >
            for my co-students, so I just decided to take it further. Best of
            all? I could do it in all 5! states I went to because of NYSC (Yes
            5! I know right??!!). Well, if you're interested in that story, then

            I was deployed to do my NYSC in Abia state. This spoiled my plan of
            getting access to various educational and financial opportunities in
            Lagos. I redeployed but was posted to Ondo state, which was less
            preferable to Abia state. That worsened everything. Money, time,
            effort, wasted. Everyone suggested that I give up - "just accept
            where you were posted, after all, you've tried your best", "don't
            bother yourself, it'll be fine". I've never believed in the concept
            of 'que sera sera'; I believe that if it's going to happen, I'm
            going to have to make it happen. I documented at Ondo State,
            borrowed some money, and reapplied for relocation. I searched
            painstakingly for a favorable establishment and served committedly
            while awaiting the confirmation of my redeployment. I wrote out a
            list of possible outcomes of the search for redeployment, from the
            most to the least desirable. “Why not just relax and settle down
            where you are? Save yourself the stress” These are comments I
            received from well-meaning people. Additionally, every redeployed
            corper I knew who was posted to a different state from where they
            wished either settled there or returned to Abia state. I, on the
            other hand, did not get a reply for weeks. After 2 months, it was
            already late. I was to remain in Ondo state. The point of this story
            is that I did not feel bad or unhappy about it; I was at peace
            because I knew I GENUINELY tried my best. And so I kept my head down
            and sought positives. It was good to confirm my GRIT and RESILIENCE.
            On the sixth day of the third month, however, my redeployment
            finally went through. I settled everything at Ondo and left for
            Lagos a week later.

            Right! So before I learned barbing, I actually took a class on
            Python. Unfortunately, my system crashed, and so I could no longer
            use it to code. I started saving for one towards the end of my
            service, and I finally got one 2 months post-service, and man's
            jumped right back into what he likes! In the first 6 weeks since
            getting a system, I explored E-commerce, Data Analytics, a bit of
            web design, and background info on Software Development and Cloud
            Computing.
